                          -- How to use Git and Github --


  - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

      When I initialize a repository I can tell Git which files I want to
      commit and Git will start tracking them. It's a good way to keep track of
      the changes introduced in one or more files.

  - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
    repository? What value do you think it offers?

      The staging area is like a waiting room. You put in there files that are
      going to be commited in the repository. It allows to commit a concrete number of
      files at a time.

  - How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
    logical change?

      Maybe typing git diff and seing the diffs between the files in the
      working directory and the files in the stage area? I don't know actually.

  - What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
    history organized? How would branches help?

      They help develop parallell versions of a program.

  - How do the diagrams help you vizualize the branch structure?

      It is a neat maner to represent everything envolved with the version
      control thing. They show the chronology, the branches, the commits...
      Everything!
