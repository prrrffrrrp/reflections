  - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

      When I initialize a repository I can tell Git which files I want to
      commit and Git will start tracking them. It's a good way to keep track of
      the changes introduced in one or more files.

  - How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
    repository? What value do you think it offers?

      The staging area is like a waiting room. You put in there files that are
      going to be commited in the repository. It allows to commit a concrete number of
      files at a time.
