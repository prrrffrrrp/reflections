  - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
  work local?
     A remote repository could be a must when working with others. Also, it can
     be convenient to have ones files in the cloud and being able to access
     them from anywhere.

  -Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
  automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The remote repository is public. Anyone can see it. Maybe you don't want to
    show everything you do.
